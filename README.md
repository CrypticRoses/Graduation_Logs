# Graduation_Logs
This is a repo that I plan to log my weekly progress, tryhackme and hackthebox notes and cloud labs, I may include and amend as I see fit. This repo will be the main repo I will be adding to until I either land or am recruited for a full time cloud security or cyber security role.
