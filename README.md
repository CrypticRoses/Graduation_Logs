# Graduation_Logs  

This repository documents my journey toward a full-time role in **cloud security** or **cybersecurity**.  
It serves as a structured logbook of my progress, hands-on labs, and technical reflections.  

---

## Purpose  

- **Weeks 0 → 5 (before 04/09/2025):** Focused on building consistency and discipline through daily reflections.  
- **From 04/09/2025 onward:** All logs are **purely technical** ;covering cybersecurity labs, cloud exercises, notes, scripts, and hands-on practical work.  

This pivot ensures the repository reflects **real technical growth** while also showing the foundation of consistency that supports it.
