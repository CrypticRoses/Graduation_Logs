Goal: Review defensive security fundamentals, malware types, and incident response concepts.

Topics / Key Points:
– Blue Team: monitors networks and systems for malicious events.
– DFIR = Digital Forensics & Incident Response.
– Threat: any action that can disrupt or adversely affect a system.
– Incident: can be a breach, intrusion attempt, misconfiguration, or policy violation.
– Incident response: structured methodology for handling incidents.
– Incident response lifecycle: Preparation, Detection & Analysis, Containment, Eradication & Recovery, Post-Incident Activity.
– Malware:
   * Virus – attaches to programs, spreads by altering/overwriting/deleting files.
   * Trojan – shows legitimate function, hides malicious behavior.
   * Ransomware – encrypts files, demands payment for decryption.
– Analysis methods:
   * Static analysis – inspect code without execution; requires assembly knowledge.
   * Dynamic analysis – run malware in controlled environment to observe behavior.
– Open-source intelligence (OSINT) for IPs: AbuseIPDB, Cisco Talos, reputation and geolocation checks.
– Knowledge check answers confirmed:
   * Blue Team monitors network events.
   * DFIR = Digital Forensics & Incident Response.
   * Ransomware requires payment to regain file access.

Reflections:
– Defensive operations complement offensive skills.  
– Intelligence gathering, incident response, and malware understanding are tightly interconnected.  
– Static vs dynamic analysis provides different insights; both are essential.  
– OSINT tools provide fast context and validation during investigations.

To-Do / Follow-Up:
– Continue Pre-Security path, complete remaining Defensive Security Intro modules.  
– Compile notes on OSINT and malware analysis for reference.  
– Practice applying IP reputation checks in a safe lab environment.  
– Begin visualizing incident response lifecycle for quick reference.
