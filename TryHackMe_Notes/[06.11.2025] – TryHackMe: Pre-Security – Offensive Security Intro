Goal: Revise enumeration concepts and refresh use of Gobuster-[https://github.com/OJ/gobuster]

Commands / Tools:
– gobuster dir -u http://bank.thm -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt  
  → Discovered hidden endpoint: /secret_transfer

Findings / Observations:
– Simulated transfer feature on the hidden page allowed moving 2000 from victim account to my account in the lab (controlled environment).
– Demonstrated lack of access control on exposed endpoints.

Concepts / Theory:
– Enumeration = mapping services, directories and endpoints after initial discovery.
– Ethical testing requires controlled environments and responsible reporting.

Reflections / Insights:
– Reinforced practical value of directory brute-forcing in early recon.
– Felt confident applying the tools after a short refresher.

To-Do / Follow-Up:
– Continue with the pre-security learning path and revisit foundational topics as I progress
– Keep a short list of commands and concepts to expand into deeper notes later
