✅ Tasks Completed:  
– Answered a multiple-choice question to confirm the scenario as offensive security.  
– Opened a terminal on a simulated, intentionally unprotected banking system 
and used Gobuster to discover a hidden page that allowed a simulated transfer of 2000 from the victim account to my account (controlled lab).  
– Completed the TryHackMe Offensive Security Intro room.

⚠️ Issues Faced:  
– None encountered during the lab exercise.

📝 Reflection:  
– Practiced enumeration techniques in a controlled, legal environment.  
– Observed how exposed endpoints and hidden pages can be abused when access controls are missing.  
– Reaffirmed the importance of ethical testing, responsible disclosure, and documenting findings clearly.

📌 Next Steps:  
– Continue with the pre-security learning path and revisit foundational topics as I progress.

📅 Upcoming Tasks:  
– Continue the pre-security learning path and refresh core concepts.  
– Keep a concise list of commands and concepts to expand into deeper notes later.  
– Share brief revision updates on LinkedIn to increase visibility with recruiters.

✅ Tasks Completed:  
– Began the TryHackMe Pre-Security learning path, progressing through the Introduction to Cyber Security and Defensive Security Intro modules.  
– Learned the roles and responsibilities of the Blue Team in defending systems through monitoring, detection, and incident response.  
– Answered the module question identifying the defensive cyber team as the Blue Team.  
– Answered knowledge-check questions correctly:  
  • DFIR stands for Digital Forensics & Incident Response  
  • The type of malware requiring payment to regain file access is Ransomware  
– Studied intelligence gathering and its importance in identifying actual and potential adversaries.  
– Reviewed the definition of a threat as any action that can disrupt or adversely affect a system.  
– Learned that an incident can refer to major attacks such as breaches, or less critical events like misconfigurations and policy violations.  
– Studied incident response and its structured methodology for managing security incidents.  
– Learned the four major phases of the incident response process: **Preparation**, **Detection and Analysis**, **Containment, Eradication and Recovery**, and **Post-Incident Activity**.  
– Reviewed common malware types, including viruses, Trojans, and ransomware.  
– Learned that a **virus** attaches to programs, spreading by altering, overwriting, or deleting files.  
– Understood that a **Trojan Horse** disguises itself as a legitimate program while performing malicious actions, often granting attackers system control.  
– Studied **ransomware**, which encrypts user files and demands payment for decryption.  
– Explored **static analysis**, which inspects malicious code without running it, requiring knowledge of assembly language and processor instructions.  
– Studied **dynamic analysis**, which involves executing malware in a controlled environment to observe its behavior safely.  
– Reviewed open-source reputation and intelligence resources (e.g., AbuseIPDB{https://www.abuseipdb.com}, Cisco Talos{https://talosintelligence.com}) for performing IP reputation and location checks.

⚠️ Issues Faced:  
– None encountered; material was clearly structured and built logically on prior lessons.

📝 Reflection:  
– Reinforced understanding of how defensive operations complement offensive practices by emphasizing prevention, detection, and response.  
– Recognized how intelligence, threats, and incidents are interconnected within the defensive lifecycle.  
– Gained clarity on the structured nature of incident response and the importance of preparation and post-incident review.  
– Strengthened foundational knowledge of malware categories and their respective behaviors.  
– Found the contrast between static and dynamic analysis valuable for understanding malware research methodologies.  
– Appreciated the practical value of open-source intelligence (OSINT) and reputation feeds for quick triage and context during investigations.  
– Answering knowledge-check questions helped consolidate terminology and core concepts like Blue Team, DFIR, and ransomware.

📌 Next Steps:  
– Continue progressing through the remaining Pre-Security modules.  
– Take focused notes on defensive tools and OSINT resources used for triage (reputation databases, passive DNS, basic geolocation).  
– Begin compiling a short reference list of reputable intelligence sources and their typical use-cases.

📅 Upcoming Tasks:  
– Complete the malware analysis and defensive operations sections within the Pre-Security path.  
– Practice using reputation/intel resources on benign example IPs to build familiarity.  
– Create a visual summary or comparison table of malware types, analysis methods, and common OSINT sources.  
– Draft a concise LinkedIn update highlighting defensive security insights and progress in the learning path.
