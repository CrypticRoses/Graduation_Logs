✅ Tasks Completed:  
– Answered a multiple-choice question to confirm the scenario as offensive security.  
– Opened a terminal on a simulated, intentionally unprotected banking system 
and used Gobuster to discover a hidden page that allowed a simulated transfer of 2000 from the victim account to my account (controlled lab).  
– Completed the TryHackMe Offensive Security Intro room.

⚠️ Issues Faced:  
– None encountered during the lab exercise.

📝 Reflection:  
– Practiced enumeration techniques in a controlled, legal environment.  
– Observed how exposed endpoints and hidden pages can be abused when access controls are missing.  
– Reaffirmed the importance of ethical testing, responsible disclosure, and documenting findings clearly.

📌 Next Steps:  
– Continue with the pre-security learning path and revisit foundational topics as I progress.

📅 Upcoming Tasks:  
– Continue the pre-security learning path and refresh core concepts.  
– Keep a concise list of commands and concepts to expand into deeper notes later.  
– Share brief revision updates on LinkedIn to increase visibility with recruiters.
