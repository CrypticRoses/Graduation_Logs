✅ Tasks Completed:  
– Conducted malware triage on a Windows laptop reporting random pop-ups.  
– Booted system offline (Airplane Mode) to prevent network exposure.  
– Verified running processes, startup programs, and Task Scheduler tasks; all entries legitimate.  
– Reviewed Protection History; noted OneDrive ransomware backup informational prompt.  
– Ran Microsoft Defender Offline Scan; no threats detected.  
– Confirmed PUA blocking and reputation-based protection active.  
– Documented system state, scan results, and observations.  
– Compiled a formal incident report and prepared documentation for handoff.  

⚠️ Issues Faced:  
– Limited information on pop-up origin; offline tools restricted deeper inspection.  
– No technical sandbox or external media available; browser-level persistence remains unverified.  

📝 Reflection:  
– No active malware detected; pop-ups likely browser-level or PUA-related.  
– Reinforced importance of **isolation, containment, and stepwise analysis** in malware triage.  
– Re-enabling PUA protection strengthened system defenses.  
– Maintained professional discipline in observation, documentation, and risk assessment.  

📌 Next Steps:  
– Left open / spontaneous, pending situational priorities.  

📅 Upcoming Tasks:  
– Handoff laptop to the provider’s friend for testing. Recommended controlled browser inspection, but they opted to test on their own network instead of engaging an expert.  
– Begin private project to automate GitHub repo entries.  
– Integrate workflow for consistent documentation and logging of future exercises.
