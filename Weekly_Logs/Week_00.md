‚úÖ Tasks Completed:  
    -Set up the 2025-Graduation-Logs GitHub repository to document learning and development progress ahead of full-time employment.  
    -Established a clear and organized folder structure:  
     
        Weekly_Logs/
        TryHackMe_Notes/
        HackTheBox_Notes/

  -Resolved initial structural and naming issues by replacing markdown files with correctly organized folders.  
  -Created the first weekly log file: Weekly_Logs/week-0.md.    
  -Clarified core GitHub concepts, including:  
  -The purpose of commits and pushes.  
  -The role of .gitignore and when it‚Äôs needed.  
  -Branching and why it's used in team-based workflows.  
  -Confirmed understanding of using the GitHub GUI effectively for smaller individual projects.  
  -Finalized a weekly logging approach for efficiency and reflection.  

‚ö†Ô∏è Issues Faced:  
  -Initial confusion around GitHub‚Äôs handling of folders vs. markdown files.  
  -Needed additional clarity on common Git features like commit structure, branches, and ignoring files.  
  -Uncertainty around what resources or sections (e.g. internship tracker, CV placement) belong in a public repository.  

üìù Reflection
  -The initial setup phase focused on ensuring the repository is scalable, readable, and professionally structured. Progress today helped solidify the foundational   knowledge required to manage documentation effectively and track progress over time.
  -Clarifying GitHub usage, adjusting the directory layout, and defining the weekly log format will streamline updates and make the repo more maintainable. Time was also allocated to defining goals and preparing for technical hands-on work beginning next week.

üìå Next Steps
üîî Immediate Tasks for Monday (28/07/2025)  
    -Begin practical work on introductory AWS cloud labs (e.g. IAM or VPC basics).  
    -Complete a beginner-level TryHackMe or Hack The Box room and document findings.  
    -Outline a weekly study plan that accounts for known scheduling constraints.  

üß≠ Planning Ahead:  
     -Scheduled personal obligations on 01/08 and 03/08 may reduce workload on those dates.  
     -Use available time to refine and tailor the CV for internship applications while awaiting final graduation classification.  
     -LinkedIn Premium will be explored at a later stage, once technical fundamentals have been re-established and relocation is complete.
